# Linear Regression Implementation

This repository contains a simple implementation of Linear Regression in Python using NumPy. The linear regression model is designed for regression tasks.

## Overview

Linear Regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables. This implementation includes a `LinearRegression` class with methods for training the model, making predictions, and evaluating performance using various metrics.

## Features

- **Model Initialization:** The `LinearRegression` class allows customization of learning rate (`lr`) and the number of iterations (`n_iters`).

- **Training the Model:** The `fit` method trains the linear regression model using gradient descent.

- **Making Predictions:** The `predict` method generates predictions based on the trained model.

- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - R-squared (R2) Score

## Usage

You can use the provided `LinearRegression` class by following these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   ```

2. Copy and paste the `LinearRegression` class into your code.

3. Create an instance of the `LinearRegression` class and use the `fit` method to train the model on your dataset.

   ```python
   model = LinearRegression(lr=0.001, n_iters=1000)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

4. Use the `predict` method to make predictions on new data.

   ```python
   predictions = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

5. Evaluate the model using various metrics.

   ```python
   mse = model.mean_squared_error(predictions, y_test)
   mae = model.mean_absolute_error(predictions, y_test)
   r2 = model.r2_score(y_test, predictions)

   print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
   print(f"Mean Absolute Error: {mae}")
   print(f"R-squared Score: {r2}")
   ```

## Parameters

- **lr (float):** Learning rate for gradient descent.
  
- **n_iters (int):** Number of iterations for gradient descent.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures the average of the squared differences between predicted and true values.

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures the average absolute differences between predicted and true values.

- **R-squared (R2) Score:** Represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).
