# Logistic Regression Implementation

This repository contains a simple implementation of Logistic Regression in Python using NumPy. The logistic regression model is designed for binary classification tasks.

## Overview

Logistic Regression is a popular machine learning algorithm used for binary classification. This implementation includes a LogisticRegression class with methods for training the model and making predictions.

## Features

- **Sigmoid Function:** The implementation includes a sigmoid function to normalize input and prevent overflow.

- **Training the Model:** The `fit` method trains the logistic regression model using gradient descent.

- **Making Predictions:** The `predict` method generates predictions based on the trained model.

- **Accuracy Score:** The `accuracy_score` method calculates the accuracy of the model on a given dataset.

## Usage

You can use the provided `LogisticRegression` class by following these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   ```

2. Copy and paste the `sigmoid` and `LogisticRegression` class into your code.

3. Create an instance of the `LogisticRegression` class and use the `fit` method to train the model on your dataset.

   ```python
   model = LogisticRegression(lr=0.01, n_iters=1000)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

4. Use the `predict` method to make predictions on new data.

   ```python
   predictions = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

5. Evaluate the model using the `accuracy_score` method.

   ```python
   accuracy = model.accuracy_score(predictions, y_test)
   print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
   ```

## Parameters

- **lr (float):** Learning rate for gradient descent.
  
- **n_iters (int):** Number of iterations for gradient descent.

## Notes

- The implementation supports binary classification tasks.

- Adjust the learning rate (`lr`) and the number of iterations (`n_iters`) based on your specific dataset.
